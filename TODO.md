# To-Do List

- **_Google Maps Basic View (Done)_**
    - **Show closest restaurants to area**
        - Define closest distance possible _(10, 20, 50m?)_
            - Closes distance will be that of 100m radius, so it can show _realistically_ the closest things available
        - Get function to print the coordinates of the closest restaurants
        - Show the markers 
            - Implement Button to toggle the markers 
    - **Show / Toggle Trafic**
        
        [ ??? ] It is another type of map
        - Get config to show map with traffic 
        - Implement button (useState) to toggle said config
